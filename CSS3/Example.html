            <p>Harmanpreet Kaur Bhullar (born 8 March 1989) is an Indian cricketer, who captains the India women's
                national team. She is a top order batter and a right-arm off-spin bowler.[1][2] She captained the Indian
                team that won the 2025 Women's Cricket World Cup, the Women's Asia Cup in 2016 and 2022, and gold medal
                in the 2022 Asian Games. She was also part of the team that won the Asia Cup in 2012 and silver medal in
                the 2022 Commonwealth Games.
                She made her One Day International debut at the age of 20 against arch-rivals Pakistan Women in the 2009
                Women's Cricket World Cup played at Bradman Oval, Bowral in March 2009. In the match, she bowled 4 overs

                Mumbai.
                In 2012, she was named as the Indian women's captain for the final of the Women's Twenty20 Asia Cup
                cricket , replacing captain Mithali Raj and vice-captain Jhulan Goswami as she was ruled out due to
                injuries.
                In the semi-final match of the 2017 Women's Cricket World Cup, Harmanpreet Kaur gave the best
                performance of her life by batting brilliantly against the Australian women's cricket team and scored
                171 runs in just 115 balls in which she hit 20 fours and 7 sixes. [ 7 ] [ 8 ]

                2022. In 2016, she was the first Indian woman to be signed by an overseas T20 franchise after joining
                Sydney Thunder in the Australian Women's Big Bash League (WBBL). She has also played for Melbourne
                Renegades in the WBBL, Manchester Originals and Trent Rockets in The Hunded.

                as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year, and was the first Indian woman to be featured in the
                list.[8] In the same year, she was also named as part of Time 100 Next,[9] and BBC's 100 Women.[10]
