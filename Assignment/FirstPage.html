                <p>The dog is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was
                    selectively bred from a population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. Dogs
                    were the first species to be domesticated over 14,000 years ago, before the development of
                    agriculture.</p>

                    The goat or domestic goat is a species of goat-antelope that is mostly kept as livestock. It was domesticated from the wild goat of Southwest Asia and Eastern Europe. The goat is a member of the family Bovidae, meaning it is closely related to the sheep.
