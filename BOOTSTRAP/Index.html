        <p>The Culture of Biryani
          Biryani isn't just a dish in Indian households. It's a meal that binds people together, creating wholesome
          experiences. Whether it's a quiet weekend or a grand celebration like Eid or Ramadan, Biryani is a must-have.
          Each family has it's own version of preparing the meal that has a story behind it. Some people might prefer
          the rich and spicy taste of Hyderabadi biryani while others may prefer the gentle, aromatic layers of Lucknowi
          biryani. Kolkata biryani adds its own royal charm, while Sindhi biryani brings bold, deep flavours. Even a
          delicious veg biryani brings joy to festive spreads.

          During Navratri, the navratna biryani brings together a mix of textures and colours, all bound by tradition.
          At the heart of all this flavour lies one secret: the rice. Not just any rice, but the finest basmati. Long,
          aromatic grains that stay separate and soak up every spice. That is what makes each bite unforgettable.
          Kohinoor Basmati Rice is trusted to carry the weight of such dishes. After all, the rice holds the soul of the
          biryani. From dum biryani to family dinners, the story always begins the same way, with good rice and a pot
          full of love.

          The Origins of Biryani: A Historical Perspective
          You'd be surprised to know that the story of biryani did not begin in India. It started in Persia, where rice
          and meat were cooked together in one pot. That early biryani recipe travelled across lands with traders,
          soldiers, and kings. It crossed deserts and borders before finding a home in Indian kitchens. When the Mughals
          came, they brought more than rule. They brought food that was rich, full of flavour, and made to be shared.
          Under their influence, the biryani turned royal. It was slow-cooked, layered with spice, and made with care.
          The dum biryani, cooked gently on low heat, is one of their lasting gifts.

          As time passed, the recipe of biryani tweaked with every region it travelled. It was shaped by strong flavours
          and was comparatively spicier in Hyderabad. Whereas it was mild and fragrant in Lucknow. The Nawabs created
          the Lucknowi biryani with its mild and balanced taste. Every ruler added their own charm that evolved the
          biryani recipe overtime. The rice became finer, the meat more tender, and the spices richer. Yet one thing
          stayed the same. Biryani remained a dish that brought comfort and joy. A plate that told a story.

          Iconic Types of Biryani Across India
          You will find a new flavour or a different way of Biryani preparation in every part of India. Here are a few
          classic versions of biryani that continue to beat hunger but don't fill heart's content.

          Hyderabadi Biryani
          Spicy, layered, and full of bold flavours, Hyderabadi biryani is often made with marinated meat cooked raw
          with rice in the dum style.

          Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent.
          Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary
          substantially and use locally available ingredients.

          Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism and Sikhism, cultural choices and
          traditions.Historical events such as invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played a role in
          introducing certain foods to India. The Columbian discovery of the New World brought a number of new
          vegetables and fruits. A number of these such as potatoes, tomatoes, chillies, peanuts, and guava have become
          staples in many regions of India.

          Indian cuisine has shaped the history of international relations; the spice trade between India and Europe was
          the primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery.Spices were bought from India and traded around Europe
          and Asia. Indian cuisine has influenced other cuisines across the world, especially those from Europe (Britain
          in particular), the Middle East, Southern Africa, East Africa, Southeast Asia, North America, Mauritius, Fiji,
          Oceania, and the Caribbean.

          World Wildlife Fund Living Planet Report released on 10 October 2024 emphasised India food
          consumption pattern as the most sustainable among the big economies (G20 countries).
